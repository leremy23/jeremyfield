  here i am enjoying some raw goat milk i picked up in petrolia, CA
  <br> i have been sensing an escalation in anti-milk energy
  <br> which is reasonable if your thinking about the unethical practices of the milk industry
  <br> but pretty much all the food in the grocery store is unethical in some way
  <br> so why did we decide to single out milk? 
  <br> just because it looks gross? and yucky? and its for slurpy old men and stupid babies?
  <br> that also doesn't make sense, a lot of foods that people don't question are way nastier than drinking milk
  <br> like a nasty-ass deli sandwhich with some fucked up bread grilled in 3 week old rancid corn oil 
  <br> made by a man who scratches his butt, all day and night
  <br> shedding his sickly skin cells and spraying saliva on ingredients that are so heavily processed they should not be considered edible??
 <br> but most people would not judge you for eating a shitty plastic sandwich like this
   <br> because eating this kind of shitty little sandwich is currently a cultural norm
  <br> so i would like to be on the side of pushing the pro-milk agenda forward
  <br> because it should be praised as one of the most affordable and nutritious foods
  <br> when i talk to people about it in a real way they usually just think its funny that i drink lots of milk
  <br> most people are neutral about it, they would agree that its gross but also agree that if you like it you should drink it
  <br> some people get excited because they also love milk but don't enjoy it fully because they think they shouldn't
  <br> milk is a superfood
   <br> also lactose intolerance can be overcome in a few weeks if you have that!
  <br> <a href="http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/milk.shtml"> painter/perceiver ray peat makes a way more intelligent argument than me in this article</a>
  <br>
  <br> <em>"the most common reason for avoiding milk is the belief that the genes of some ethnic groups cause them to lack the enzyme,<br>
  lactase, needed to digest milk sugar, lactose, and that this causes lactose intolerance, resulting in gas or diarrhea when milk is consumed. <br>
  Tests have been reported in which a glass of milk will cause the lactase deficient people to have abdominal pain. <br>
  However, when intolerant people have been tested, using milk without lactose for comparison, 
  <br>there were no differences between those receiving milk with lactose or without it. <br>
  The “intolerant” people consistently tolerate having a glass with each meal.<br>
<br>
When a group of lactase deficient people have been given some milk every day for a few weeks, they have adapted, 
  <br> for example with tests showing that much less hydrogen gas was produced from lactose by intestinal bacteria after they had adapted (Pribila, et al., 2000).
<br>
Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine can be caused by hypothyroidism (Lauritano, et al., 2007), 
  <br>and the substances produced by these bacteria can damage the lining of the small intestine, causing the loss of lactase enzymes (Walshe, et al., 1990)."
