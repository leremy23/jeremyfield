  Here I am enjoying some raw goat milk I picked up in Petrolia, CA.
            <br>
  <br> I have been feeling an escalation in anti-milk energy. Which is reasonable if your thinking 
            about the unethical practices of the milk industry. But I would say most of the foods in
            the grocery store are unethical in some way.
  <br><br> So why single out milk? <br>
  <br> Because it looks gross? And yucky? And it's for slurpy old men and stupid babies?<br>
  <br> A lot of foods that people don't question are way nastier than drinking milk. For example, a nasty-ass deli 
            sandwhich with some fucked up bread. Grilled in 3 week old rancid corn oil. Made by a man who scratches his butt, all day and night, 
            shedding his defeated skin cells and spraying his saliva on grossly modified ingredients that are so heavily processed they should not be considered edible.
 <br><br> Most people would not judge you for eating a heavily contaminated piece of plastic like this because eating this kind of shitty little sandwich is currently a cultural norm.
  <br> <br>I am on the side of pushing the pro-milk agenda forward.
            <br>
  <br> When I talk to people about it in a real way about they usually just think its funny that I drink lots of milk.
  <br> Most people are neutral about it.
  <br> They would agree that it's gross but also agree that if you like it you should drink it.
  <br> Some people get excited because they also love milk but don't enjoy it fully because they think they shouldn't.
              <br>
  <br> Milk is a superfood.
   <br> Lactose intolerance can be overcome quickly and easily if you have that!
  <br> painter/perceiver ray peat makes a way more intelligent argument than me in this <a href="http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/milk.shtml"> article.</a>
  <br>
              
  <br> <em>"the most common reason for avoiding milk is the belief that the genes of some ethnic groups cause them to lack the enzyme,<br>
  lactase, needed to digest milk sugar, lactose, and that this causes lactose intolerance, resulting in gas or diarrhea when milk is consumed. <br>
  Tests have been reported in which a glass of milk will cause the lactase deficient people to have abdominal pain. <br>
  However, when intolerant people have been tested, using milk without lactose for comparison, 
  <br>there were no differences between those receiving milk with lactose or without it. <br>
  The “intolerant” people consistently tolerate having a glass with each meal.<br>
<br>
When a group of lactase deficient people have been given some milk every day for a few weeks, they have adapted, 
  <br> for example with tests showing that much less hydrogen gas was produced from lactose by intestinal bacteria after they had adapted (Pribila, et al., 2000).
<br>
Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine can be caused by hypothyroidism (Lauritano, et al., 2007), 
  <br>and the substances produced by these bacteria can damage the lining of the small intestine, causing the loss of lactase enzymes (Walshe, et al., 1990)."
