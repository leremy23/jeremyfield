  <summary>i luv my bitch</summary>
              <p>holy shit i love my bitch<br>
even heart in every sitch<br>
and when i’m a stupid bitch<br>
she gives me a belly itch<br>
<br>
holy fuck, holy shit<br>
that was lunch when i was six<br>
that’s why i felt fucking sick<br>
cuz they poisoned every sip<br>
<br>
john wasn’t innocent<br>
he smashed his car when i was ten<br>
alex didn’t fit<br>
so he’s gonna drown again<br>
try to take it out real quick<br>
but only smashed a couple bricks<br>
and when i can’t close my fist<br>
that’s when i receive a kiss<br>
<br>
first they stabbed my elliot smith<br>
tell me he was sad and sick<br>
raised on the tap and bit by a tick<br>
now i’m a dud, now i’m a bitch<br>
and then they tried to cast a string<br>
from a spire to my wing<br>
but the warmth and wealth she brings<br>
i scorn to change my state with king<br>

                                    and they cast their cards and keys to god<br>
                                    and they built a church, and they carved a panel out<br>
                                    it said fool me again, well then we shoot<br>
                                    shoot, shoot, i'm gonna shoot<br>

    <p>our day is over<br>
and now we’re in a shadow<br>
a gilded frame<br>
a wire holding too much weight<br>
<br>
she climbed up on her roof<br>
cuz she had to see the moon<br>
she slipped and fell<br>
all that landed was an old world shell<br>
<br>
you made the club feel like my room<br>
you made my camry feel cool<br>
crack the whip and left a scar<br>
do i make you proud i try so hard<br>
<br>
her day is over  <br>
and now she’s in a shadow<br>
she wasn't done<br>
but she gave enough<br>
             </p></details>
