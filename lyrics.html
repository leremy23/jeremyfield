  <summary>i luv my bitch</summary>
              <p>holy shit i love my bitch<br>
even heart in every sitch<br>
and when i’m a stupid bitch<br>
she gives me a belly itch<br>
<br>
holy fuck, holy shit<br>
that was lunch when i was six<br>
that’s why i felt fucking sick<br>
cuz they poisoned every sip<br>
<br>
john wasn’t innocent<br>
he smashed his car when i was ten<br>
epstein didn’t fit<br>
so he’s gonna drown again<br>
try to take it out real quick<br>
but only smashed a couple bricks<br>
and when i can’t close my fist<br>
that’s when i receive a kiss<br>
<br>
first they stabbed my elliot smith<br>
tell me he was sad and sick<br>
raised on the tap and bit by a tick<br>
now i’m a dud, now i’m a bitch<br>
and then they tried to cast a string<br>
from a spire to my wing<br>
but the warmth and wealth she brings<br>
i scorn to change my state with king<br>

        john maus shirt<br>
        our day is over<br>
        pink diamond<br>
        fooled me once<br>
        missed the hit<br>
        life warmth<br>
        too hard<br>
