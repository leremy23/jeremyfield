             “If oxygen is withheld from tissues of a higher organism for a longer period, <br>
             death follows. If, however, oxygen is withheld but periodically, <br>
             as in the experiments of Cameron and Goldblatt, and restored before death ensues, <br>
                                      then we can expect no only that the oxidative system will become <br>
                                      disorganized but also that there will be degeneration of all those higher <br>
                                      functions and regulation which demands structure and a perturbed electromagnetic <br>
                                      field for their function and energization. The cell will thus revert to a more <br>
                                      primitive way of life with its lower level of organization, which is not dependent <br>
                                      on ordered structures, which also lacks the subtle regulations and has thus <br>
                                      (as in yeast) unlimited proliferation as one of its characteristics, and can depend<br>
                                      for its energy supply only on fermentation.” <br>

"One method for the destruction of the respiration of body cells is removal of oxygen. <br>
  If, for example, embryonal tissue is exposed to an oxygen deficiency for some hours <br>
  and then is placed in oxygen again, 50 percent or more of the respiration is usually destroyed. <br>
  The cause of this destruction of respiration is lack of energy. As a matter of fact, the cells <br>
  need their respiratory energy to preserve their structure, and if respiration is inhibited, both <br>
  structure and respiration disappear. Another method for destroying respiration is to use respiratory poisons. <br>
  From the standpoint of energy, this method comes to the same result as the first method. <br>
  No matter whether oxygen is withdrawn from the cell or whether the oxygen is prevented from <br>
  reacting by a poison, the result is the same in both cases-namely, impairment of respiration<br>
  from lack of energy." <br>

“A point made by Otto Warburg and Albert Szent-Györgyi and others is that there is an important<br>
  difference between the energy provided by glycolysis and that provided by mitochondrial respiration. <br>
  They felt that glycolysis was a more primitive form of energy production, and supported only primitive<br>
  function and cell division, while the more efficient respiration supported cell differentiation <br>
  and complex functioning.” <br>

"During the bloods movement through the body the oxygen-pressure will decrease to a relatively low value,<br>
  whereas at the same time the carbon dioxide-pressure rises. This will greatly support the <br>
  oxygen release from the blood, resulting in an improved efficiency in oxygen usage... The carbon dioxide <br>
  pressure of the blood is therefore to be regarded as an important factor in the inner respiratory metabolism, <br>
  which itself can be regulated by it in a very effective way. Furthermore our experiments help to <br>
  explain different observations on the supporting effect of carbon dioxide in cases of oxygen lack:<br>
  If one uses carbon dioxide in appropriate amounts, the oxygen uptake of the lungs will not be influenced, <br>
  whereas the oxygen, that was taken up can be used more effectively throughout the body." <br>

"Definition and Terminology of Biologic Stress: A great deal of confusion has arisen in lay and even in <br>
  scientific literature because the term stress means different things to different people. Stress is <br>
  part of our daily human experience, but it is associated with a great variety of essentially dissimilar <br>
  problems, such as surgical trauma, burns, emotional arousal, mental or physical effort, fatigue, pain, <br>
  fear, the need for concentration, the humiliation of frustration, the loss of blood, intoxication with drugs 
  or environmental pollutants, or even with the kind of unexpected success that requires an individual to <br>
  reformulate his lifestyle. Stress is present in the businessman under constant pressure; in the athlete<br>
  <br>straining to win a race; in the air-traffic controller who bears continuous responsibility for hundreds<br>
  of lives; in the husband helplessly watching his wife's slow, painful death from cancer; in a race horse, its <br>
  jockey and the spectator who bets on them. Medical research has shown that, while all these subjects face quite<br>
  different problems, they respond with a stereotyped pattern of biochemical, functional and structural changes <br>
  essentially involved in coping with any type of increased demand upon vital activity, particularly adaptation <br>
  to new situations. All endogenous or exogenous agents that make such demands are called stressors. Distinguishing<br>
  between their widely differing specific effects and the common biologic response that they elicit is the key to<br>
  a proper understanding of biologic stress." <br>
[...]
"In fact, we shall see that biologic stress is closely linked to, though not identical with, <br>
  energy utilization. This explains its apparently paradoxical, yet inseparable combination<br>
  with the specific effects of the particular agent that creates a need for adaptive work. <br>
  Any demand made on the body must be for some particular, that is, specific activity and<br>
  yet is inseparably associated with non-specific phenomena (that is, energy utilization), <br>
  just as in the inanimate world specific demands made upon machines to increase or decrease <br>
  room temperature, to produce light or sound, to accelerate or decrease motion are invariably <br>
  dependent upon energy utilization."<br><br><br>
—Stress in Health and Disease by Hans Selye (1976)<br>
"The extraordinarily unstable stuff of which our bodies are constituted is <br>
  persistently subjected to various external and internal conditions which,<br>
  if not resisted, would profoundly alter its ability to function." <br>
