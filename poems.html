    My Light with Yours  <br> 
Edgar Lee Masters <br> <br>
                       I  <br> 
  <br> 
When the sea has devoured the ships,  <br> 
And the spires and the towers  <br> 
Have gone back to the hills.  <br> 
And all the cities  <br> 
Are one with the plains again.  <br> 
And the beauty of bronze,  <br> 
And the strength of steel  <br> 
Are blown over silent continents,  <br> 
As the desert sand is blown—  <br> 
My dust with yours forever.  <br> 
  <br> 
                       II  <br> 
  <br> 
When folly and wisdom are no more,  <br> 
And fire is no more,  <br> 
Because man is no more;  <br> 
When the dead world slowly spinning  <br> 
Drifts and falls through the void—  <br> 
My light with yours  <br> 
In the Light of Lights forever!   <br> 
     <br>

  Poor Young Things<br>D.H. Lawrence<br><br>
The young to-day are born prisoners,<br>
poor things, and they know it.<br>
Born in a universal workhouse,<br>
and they feel it.<br>
Inheriting a sort of confinement,<br>
work, and prisoners’ routine<br>
and prisoners’ flat, ineffectual pastime.<br>
       <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br>

  What Have They Done to You?<br> D.H. Lawrence<br><br>
What have they done to you, men of the masses, creeping back and forth to work?<br>
<br>
What have they done to you, the saviours of the people, oh what have they saved you from, while they pocketed the money?<br>
<br>
Alas, they have saved you from yourself, from your own frail dangers<br>
and devoured you with the machine, the vast maw of iron.<br>
<br>
They saved you from your squalid cottages and poverty of hand to much<br>
and embedded you in workmen’s dwellings, where your wage is the dole of work, and the dole is your wage of nullity.<br>
<br>
They took away, oh they took away your man’s native instincts and intuitions<br>
and gave you a board-school education, newspapers, and the cinema.<br>
<br>
They stole your body from you, and left you an animated carcass<br>
to work with, and nothing else:<br>
unless goggling eyes, to goggle at the film<br>
and a board-school brain, stuffed up with the ha’penny press.<br>
<br>
Your instincts gone, your intuitions gone, your passions dead<br>
Oh carcass with a board-school mind and a ha’penny newspaper intelligence,<br>
what have they done to you, what have they done to you, Oh what have they done to you?<br>
<br>
Oh look at my fellow-men, oh look at them<br>
the masses! Oh, what has been done to them?<br>
     <br> 
   <br>

 If You are a Man   <br> D.H. Lawrence   <br> <br> 
If you are a man, and believe in the destiny of mankind<br>
then say to yourself: we will cease to care<br>
about property and money and mechanical devices,<br>
and open our consciousness to the deep, mysterious life<br>
that we are now cut off from.<br>
<br>
The machine shall be abolished from the earth again;<br>
it is a mistake that mankind has made;<br>
money shall cease to be, and property shall cease to perplex<br>
and we will find the way to immediate contact with life<br>
and with one another.<br>
<br>
To know the moon as we have never known<br>
yet she is knowable.<br>
To know a man as we have never known<br>
a man, as never yet a man was knowable, yet still shall be.<br>

  The Schoolboy <br> William Blake <br> <br> 
  I love to rise in a summer morn,<br> 
When the birds sing on every tree;<br> 
The distant huntsman winds his horn,<br> 
And the skylark sings with me:<br> 
O what sweet company!<br> 
<br> 
But to go to school in a summer morn, -<br> 
O it drives all joy away!<br> 
Under a cruel eye outworn,<br> 
The little ones spend the day<br> 
In sighing and dismay.<br> 
<br> 
Ah then at times I drooping sit,<br> 
And spend many an anxious hour;<br> 
Nor in my book can I take delight,<br> 
Nor sit in learning's bower,<br> 
Worn through with the dreary shower.<br> 
<br> 
How can the bird that is born for joy<br> 
Sit in a cage and sing?<br> 
How can a child, when fears annoy,<br> 
But droop his tender wing,<br> 
And forget his youthful spring!<br> 
<br> 
O father and mother if buds are nipped,<br> 
And blossoms blown away;<br> 
And if the tender plants are stripped<br> 
Of their joy in the springing day,<br> 
By sorrow and care's dismay, -<br> 
<br> 
How shall the summer arise in joy,<br> 
Or the summer fruits appear?<br> 
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,<br> 
Or bless the mellowing year,<br> 
When the blasts of winter appear?<br> 
  <br> 
  <br>       <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br>

  Laughing Song <br> William Blake <br><br>
When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,<br>
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;<br>
When the air does laugh with our merry wit,<br>
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;<br>
<br>
When the meadows laugh with lively green,<br>
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene;<br>
When Mary and Susan and Emily<br>
With their sweet round mouths sing ‘Ha ha he!’<br>
<br>
When the painted birds laugh in the shade,<br>
Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:<br>
Come live, and be merry, and join with me,<br>
To sing the sweet chorus of ‘Ha ha he!’<br><br><br>
   <br>

The Monk and His Cat<br> 
adapted by W. H. Auden from an 8th or 9th century anonymous Irish text<br> 
<br> 
Pangur, white Pangur,<br> 
How happy we are<br> 
Alone together, Scholar and cat.<br> 
Each has his own work to do daily;<br> 
For you it is hunting, for me, study.<br> 
Your shining eye watches the wall;<br> 
My feeble eye is fixed on a book.<br> 
You rejoice when your claws entrap a mouse;<br> 
I rejoice when my mind fathoms a problem.<br> 
Pleased with his own art<br> 
Neither hinders the other;<br> 
Thus we live ever<br> 
Without tedium and envy.<br> 
Pangur, white Pangur,<br> 
How happy we are,<br> 
Alone together, Scholar and cat.<br>
