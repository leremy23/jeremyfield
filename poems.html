    My Light with Yours  <br> 
Edgar Lee Masters <br> <br>
                       I  <br> 
  <br> 
When the sea has devoured the ships,  <br> 
And the spires and the towers  <br> 
Have gone back to the hills.  <br> 
And all the cities  <br> 
Are one with the plains again.  <br> 
And the beauty of bronze,  <br> 
And the strength of steel  <br> 
Are blown over silent continents,  <br> 
As the desert sand is blown—  <br> 
My dust with yours forever.  <br> 
  <br> 
                       II  <br> 
  <br> 
When folly and wisdom are no more,  <br> 
And fire is no more,  <br> 
Because man is no more;  <br> 
When the dead world slowly spinning  <br> 
Drifts and falls through the void—  <br> 
My light with yours  <br> 
In the Light of Lights forever!   <br> 
     <br>

  Poor Young Things<br>D.H. Lawrence<br><br>
The young to-day are born prisoners,<br>
poor things, and they know it.<br>
Born in a universal workhouse,<br>
and they feel it.<br>
Inheriting a sort of confinement,<br>
work, and prisoners’ routine<br>
and prisoners’ flat, ineffectual pastime.<br>
       <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
     <br>

  What Have They Done to You?<br> D.H. Lawrence<br><br>
What have they done to you, men of the masses, creeping back and forth to work?<br>
<br>
What have they done to you, the saviours of the people, oh what have they saved you from, while they pocketed the money?<br>
<br>
Alas, they have saved you from yourself, from your own frail dangers<br>
and devoured you with the machine, the vast maw of iron.<br>
<br>
They saved you from your squalid cottages and poverty of hand to much<br>
and embedded you in workmen’s dwellings, where your wage is the dole of work, and the dole is your wage of nullity.<br>
<br>
They took away, oh they took away your man’s native instincts and intuitions<br>
and gave you a board-school education, newspapers, and the cinema.<br>
<br>
They stole your body from you, and left you an animated carcass<br>
to work with, and nothing else:<br>
unless goggling eyes, to goggle at the film<br>
and a board-school brain, stuffed up with the ha’penny press.<br>
<br>
Your instincts gone, your intuitions gone, your passions dead<br>
Oh carcass with a board-school mind and a ha’penny newspaper intelligence,<br>
what have they done to you, what have they done to you, Oh what have they done to you?<br>
<br>
Oh look at my fellow-men, oh look at them<br>
the masses! Oh, what has been done to them?<br>
     <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
 If You are a Man   <br> D.H. Lawrence   <br> 
If you are a man, and believe in the destiny of mankind<br>
then say to yourself: we will cease to care<br>
about property and money and mechanical devices,<br>
and open our consciousness to the deep, mysterious life<br>
that we are now cut off from.<br>
<br>
The machine shall be abolished from the earth again;<br>
it is a mistake that mankind has made;<br>
money shall cease to be, and property shall cease to perplex<br>
and we will find the way to immediate contact with life<br>
and with one another.<br>
<br>
To know the moon as we have never known<br>
yet she is knowable.<br>
To know a man as we have never known<br>
a man, as never yet a man was knowable, yet still shall be.<br>
<br>
