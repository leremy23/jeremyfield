  <br>  
    My Light with Yours  <br> 
Edgar Lee Masters <br> <br>
                       I  <br> 
  <br> 
When the sea has devoured the ships,  <br> 
And the spires and the towers  <br> 
Have gone back to the hills.  <br> 
And all the cities  <br> 
Are one with the plains again.  <br> 
And the beauty of bronze,  <br> 
And the strength of steel  <br> 
Are blown over silent continents,  <br> 
As the desert sand is blown—  <br> 
My dust with yours forever.  <br> 
  <br> 
                       II  <br> 
  <br> 
When folly and wisdom are no more,  <br> 
And fire is no more,  <br> 
Because man is no more;  <br> 
When the dead world slowly spinning  <br> 
Drifts and falls through the void—  <br> 
My light with yours  <br> 
In the Light of Lights forever!  <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
 If You are a Man   <br> D.H. Lawrence   <br> 
If you are a man, and believe in the destiny of mankind<br>
then say to yourself: we will cease to care<br>
about property and money and mechanical devices,<br>
and open our consciousness to the deep, mysterious life<br>
that we are now cut off from.<br>
<br>
The machine shall be abolished from the earth again;<br>
it is a mistake that mankind has made;<br>
money shall cease to be, and property shall cease to perplex<br>
and we will find the way to immediate contact with life<br>
and with one another.<br>
<br>
To know the moon as we have never known<br>
yet she is knowable.<br>
To know a man as we have never known<br>
a man, as never yet a man was knowable, yet still shall be.<br>
<br>
