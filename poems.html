  <br>  
    My Light with Yours  <br> 
Edgar Lee Masters - 1868-1950  <br> 
                       I  <br> 
  <br> 
When the sea has devoured the ships,  <br> 
And the spires and the towers  <br> 
Have gone back to the hills.  <br> 
And all the cities  <br> 
Are one with the plains again.  <br> 
And the beauty of bronze,  <br> 
And the strength of steel  <br> 
Are blown over silent continents,  <br> 
As the desert sand is blown—  <br> 
My dust with yours forever.  <br> 
  <br> 
                       II  <br> 
  <br> 
When folly and wisdom are no more,  <br> 
And fire is no more,  <br> 
Because man is no more;  <br> 
When the dead world slowly spinning  <br> 
Drifts and falls through the void—  <br> 
My light with yours  <br> 
In the Light of Lights forever!  <br>
