Music speaks to all<br>
It's so dear to us<br>
Music makes us think<br>
So mysterious<br>
Music is my Sanctuary, Music is my life<br>
Music is my Sanctuary, Music is my life<br>
        <br>
Music makes you smile<br>
It's optimistical<br>
It can make you sad<br>
It's so lyrical<br>
Music is my Sanctuary, Music is my life<br>
Music is my Sanctuary, Music is my life<br>
        <br>
Music makes you dance<br>
So rythmical<br>
Puts you in a trance<br>
Hypnotical<br>
Music is my Sanctuary, Music is my life<br>
Music is my Sanctuary, Music is my life<br>
        <br>
Music is my life<br>
Music is my life<br>
Music is my life<br>
