good ideas come from people resonating together<br>
<br>
when you resonate with others, it gives you more freedom to become yourself.<br>
<br>
information gained through personal experience is the most reliable.<br>
<br>
writing songs is a way to form a therapeutic relationship with someone you've never met. you can let them know you have felt the same way.
<br>
<br>
every song is its own universe, or organ, with energy flowing in different directions. <br> you can look at music like a group of cells with distinct personalities playing together to create solutions.<br>
<br>
music is a great way to put new energy into the culture and improve people's environments.
