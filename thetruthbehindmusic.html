<h3>information gained through personal experience is the most reliable<br>
<br>
good ideas come from groups of people resonating together.<br>
<br>
and when you resonate with others, it gives you more freedom to become yourself .<br>
<br>
you vibrate together and become an organ with a function, rather than an individual trying to impose an ideology on others.<br>
<br>
you can look at elements of music like cells with their own distinct personalities, working together to fill in the gaps and generate new energy<br>
<br>
every song is its own universe, with lots of energy flowing in many different directions creating structure<br>
<br>
Music is a way to change peopleâ€™s environment, which changes the people as well<br>
<br>
music is a way to put new excess energy into the culture<br>
<br>
important to remember that being a "musician" is a cultural mask<br>
<br>
should language even be involved when thinking about music?<br>
should the intellect even be used when making music?<br>
should it just be guided purely by the animal instict? and pure, strong feelings?<br>
<br>
